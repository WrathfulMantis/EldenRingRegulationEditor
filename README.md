This is a program intended to edit the Regulation.bin for Elden Ring.
It is a personal project mostly so I can practice c++, if you've found this there might be more developed options out there for you

As of right now I'm mostly rewriting scripts I've written in the past in formats that this program accepts

Features are limited but include:
Importing CSV exports of the ash of war file (Exported with Yapped)
Exporting a CSV of the ash of war file (Usable with Yapped)
Enabling and disabling any individual option on an ash of war within a file
Mass enabling/dissabling affinities within a file
Mass enabling which weapons ashes are able to be applied to

This is very early in development so the featurelist should improve
